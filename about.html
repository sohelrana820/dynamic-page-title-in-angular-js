<p class="lead">Hi,</p>

<p class="lead">It's Sohel Rana. I am a professional, passionate and creative software engineer in Bangladesh. I am working as a Software Engineer at preview ICT. I have completed my graduation from Daffodil International University in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

<p class="lead">I deeply involved with web technology from last 6 years,  and always try to do something different. I spent most of my time with coding,  analyzing, learning about it. Truly now it's become my passion of my life. I love to work, and play with code, it's my lovely pleasure. Every time I try to learn something new, and keep me update with the latest technique and technology that's most important to a tech guy.</p>

<p class="lead">I am specialized to develop secure, reliable, high performance web application according to client's requirement. I am familiar with latest tools & technology, open sources libraries. These are very essential to build an application compact, secure, and reliable. And also I contribute some open source community, discuss with them, positive argument, share our ideas.</p>

<p class="lead">I always maintain some convention while I do programming (Naming convention, PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2), that's why my code easily understandable to other programmer also, I Always try to write clean, dry and simple code. I never like fatty code, it's really annoying.</p>

<p class="lead">I got inspiration from one of my special person  G.M Shaharia Azam. I learned my first code from him. He lead me to right way and still he doing that job. Today I am here and all credit goes to him. A special thank to him (Thanks Buddy).</p>
